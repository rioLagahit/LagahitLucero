	<div class="innerBox">
		<ol>
		<li>Read the FAQ for explanations on downloads access and many other issues.</li>

		<li>Ignorance is not an excuse for violating the rules. </li>

		<li>No Flaming. No Harassing. No trolling. No embarrassing other members.</li>

		<li>No spamming.</li>

		<li>No double-posting. </li>

		<li>Explicit topics about Religion, Drugs and Sex are PROHIBITED. </li>

		<li>No 18+/X-rated/"Mature audiences only" material, and no links to sites with that kind of content (that means hentai, shoutacon and lolicon). </li>

		<li>Mods keep the right to close any topic if the discussion is getting old and repetative. A topic can be reopened by a PM request to the mod in charge.</li>

		<li>No advertising / linking to other websites. We also dislike other forum members trying to steal our members and lure them into their own forums. That includes harassing them via pms, e-mail, on forums or visitor messages.</li>

		<li>Read each forum's rules before posting in it.</li>

		<li>Do not revive topics that have been inactive for more than 30 days without the moderator's permission.</li>

		<li>This is an English Language forum. Foreign languages are not allowed.</li>

		<li>Don't make more than one account.</li>

		<li>Please don't write in all capitals (LIKE THIS), or in that strange cap/no-cap method which some people use (LikE ThIs). </li>

		<li>Mods/Staff have the right to ignore any requests / questions if they find that you have not read the Rules and/or FAQ</li>

		<li>Please do not copy posts/reviews/anything else as your own. If you wish to make a comment on what someone else has said, please use quote to indicate the work is not yours.</li>

		<li>Don't share licensed stuff.</li>

		<li>Signatures can only have a maximum of <u>3</u> visible horizontal images. </li>

		<li>Also keep in mind not to have long vertical images in your signature. After those 3 images you may hide the rest of your images in at most two spoilers. Compress your images. PNG is not always the best way to save your sig images, try to use PNG only if you need transparency in your images. Larger images (such as family trees) need to be linked! Do not show the image but link to it.</li>

		<li>No hentai. That includes links to sites that have hentai or any sexual content.</li>

		<li>Public discussions of staff decisions are not permitted on the site. </li>

		<li>No direct Linking to Images. (Don't copy images from other forums or sites. Save then and upload them here or at a site such as photobucket.)</li>
